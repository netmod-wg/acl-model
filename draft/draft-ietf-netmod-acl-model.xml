      <t>This document defines a data model for Access Control List (ACL). An
      ACL is a user-ordered set of rules, used to configure the forwarding
      behavior in device. Each rule is used to find a match on a packet, and
      define actions that will be performed on the packet.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>Access Control List (ACL) is one of the basic elements used to
      configure device forwarding behavior. It is used in many networking
      technologies such as Policy Based Routing, Firewalls etc.</t>

      <t>An ACL is an user-ordered set of rules, that is used to filter
      traffic on a networking device. Each rule is represented by an Access
      Control Entry (ACE).</t>

      <t>Each ACE has a group of match criteria and a group of action
      criteria.</t>

      <t>The match criteria allows for definition of packet headers and
      metadata, all of which must be true for the match to occur.</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Packet header matches apply to fields visible in the packet such
          as address or Class of Service (CoS) or port numbers.</t>

          <t>In case a vendor supports it, metadata matches apply to fields
          associated with the packet but not in the packet header such as
          input interface or overall packet length</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The actions specify what to do with the packet when the matching
      criteria is met. These actions are any operations that would apply to
      the packet, such as counting, policing, or simply forwarding. The list
      of potential actions is unbounded depending on the capabilities of the
      networking devices.</t>

      <t>Access Control List is also widely knowns as ACL (pronounce as [ak-uh
      l]) or Access List. In this document, Access Control List, ACL and
      Access List are used interchangeably.</t>

      <t>The matching of filters and actions in an ACE/ACL are triggered only
      after application/attachment of the ACL to an interface, VRF, vty/tty
      session, QoS policy, routing protocols amongst various other config
      attachment points. Once attached, it is used for filtering traffic using
      the match criteria in the ACE's and taking appropriate action(s) that
      have been configured against that ACE. In order to apply an ACL to any
      attachment point other than an interface, vendors would have to augment
      the ACL YANG model.</t>

    <section anchor="problem" title="Problem Statement">
      <t>This document defines a <xref target="RFC7950">YANG</xref> data model
      for the configuration of ACLs. It is very important that model can be
      used easily by applications/attachments.</t>

      <t>ACL implementations in every device may vary greatly in terms of the
      filter constructs and actions that they support. Therefore this draft
      proposes a model that can be augmented by standard extensions and vendor
      proprietary models.</t>
    </section>

    <!-- problem -->

    <section anchor="design" title="Understanding ACL's Filters and Actions">
      <t>Although different vendors have different ACL data models, there is a
      common understanding of what Access Control List (ACL) is. A network
      system usually has a list of ACLs, and each ACL contains an ordered list
      of rules, also known as Access Control Entries (ACE). Each ACE has a
      group of match criteria and a group of action criteria. The match
      criteria allows for definition of packet headers or metadata, if
      supported by the vendor. Packet header matching applies to fields
      visible in the packet such as address or CoS or port numbers. Metadata
      matching applies to fields associated with the packet, but not in the
      packet header such as input interface, packet length, or source or
      destination prefix length. The actions can be any sort of operation from
      logging to rate limiting or dropping to simply forwarding. Actions on
      the first matching ACE are applied with no processing of subsequent
      ACEs.</t>

      <t>The model also includes a container to hold overall operational state
      for each ACL and operational state for each ACE. One ACL can be applied
      to multiple targets within the device, such as interface of a networking
      device, applications or features running in the device, etc. When
      applied to interfaces of a networked device, distinct ACLs are defined
      for the ingress (input) or egress (output) interface.</t>

      <t>This draft tries to address the commonalities between all vendors and
      create a common model, which can be augmented with proprietary models.
      The base model is simple in design, and we hope to achieve enough
      flexibility for each vendor to extend the base model.</t>

      <t>The use of feature statements in the model allows vendors to
      advertise match rules they are capable and willing to support. There are
      two sets of feature statements a device needs to advertise. The first
      set of feature statements specify the capability of the device. These
      include features such as "Device can support ethernet headers" or
      "Device can support of IPv4 headers". The second set of feature
      statements specify the combinations of headers the device is willing to
      support. These include features such as "Plain IPv6 ACL supported" or
      "Ethernet, IPv4 and IPv6 ACL combinations supported".</t>

      <section anchor="aclmodules" title="ACL Modules">
        <t>There are two YANG modules in the model. The first module,
        "ietf-access-control-list", defines generic ACL aspects which are
        common to all ACLs regardless of their type or vendor. In effect, the
        module can be viewed as providing a generic ACL "superclass". It
        imports the second module, "ietf-packet-fields". The match container
        in "ietf-access-control-list" uses groupings in "ietf-packet-fields"
        to specify match fields such as port numbers or protocol. The
        combination of 'if-feature' checks and 'must' statements allow for the
        selection of relevant match fields that a user can define rules
        for.</t>

        <t>If there is a need to define a new "matches" choice, such as <xref
        target="RFC7011">IPFIX</xref>, the container "matches" can be
        augmented.</t>

    <section anchor="yangmodel" title="ACL YANG Models">
      <section anchor="ietfacl" title="IETF Access Control List module">
        <t>"ietf-access-control-list" module defines the "acls" container that
        has a list of "acl". Each "acl" has information identifying the access
        list by a name ("name") and a list ("aces") of rules associated with
        the "name". Each of the entries in the list ("aces"), indexed by the
        string "name", has containers defining "matches" and "actions".</t>

        <t>The model defines several ACL types and actions in the form of
        identities and features. Features are used by implementors to select
        the ACL types the system can support and identities are used to
        validate the types that have been selected. These types are implicitly
        inherited by the "ace", thus safeguarding against misconfiguration of
        "ace" types in an "acl".</t>

        <t>The "matches" define criteria used to identify patterns in
        "ietf-packet-fields". The choice statements within the match container
        allow for selection of one header within each of "l2", "l3", or "l4"
        headers. The "actions" define behavior to undertake once a "match" has
        been identified. In addition to permit and deny for actions, a logging
        option allows for a match to be logged that can later be used to
        determine which rule was matched upon. The model also defines the
        ability for ACLs to be attached to a particular interface.</t>

        <t>Statistics in the ACL can be collected for an "ace" or for an
        "interface". The feature statements defined for statistics can be used
        to determine whether statistics are being collected per "ace", or per
        "interface".</t>

        <t>This module imports definitions from <xref target="RFC6991">Common
        YANG Data Types</xref>, and <xref target="RFC8343">A YANG Data Model
        for Interface Management</xref>.</t>

        <t>The packet fields module defines the necessary groups for matching
        on fields in the packet including ethernet, ipv4, ipv6, and transport

        included for any given ACL with the exception of TCP, UDP and ICMP
        header fields. Those fields can be used in conjunction with any of the
        above layer 2 or layer 3 fields.</t>

        <t>Since the number of match criteria is very large, the base draft
        does not include these directly but references them by 'uses'
        statement to keep the base module simple. In case more match

      <t>Alex Clemm, Andy Bierman and Lisa Huang started it by sketching out
      an initial IETF draft in several past IETF meetings. That draft included
      an ACL YANG model structure and a rich set of match filters, and
      acknowledged contributions by Louis Fourie, Dana Blair, Tula Kraiser,
      Patrick Gili, George Serpa, Martin Bjorklund, Kent Watsen, and Phil
      Shafer. Many people have reviewed the various earlier drafts that made
      the draft went into IETF charter.</t>

      <t>Dean Bogdanovic, Kiran Agrahara Sreenivasa, Lisa Huang, and Dana
      Blair each evaluated the YANG model in previous drafts separately, and
      then worked together to created a ACL draft that was supported by
      different vendors. That draft removed vendor specific features, and gave
      examples to allow vendors to extend in their own proprietary ACL. The
      earlier draft was superseded with this updated draft and received more
      participation from many vendors.</t>

      <t>Authors would like to thank Jason Sterne, Lada Lhotka, Juergen
      Schoenwalder, David Bannister, Jeff Haas, Kristian Larsson and Einar
      Nilsen-Nygaard for their review of and suggestions to the draft.</t>

      <section anchor="newcoacl" title="A company proprietary module example">
        <t>Module "example-newco-acl" is an example of company proprietary
        model that augments "ietf-acl" module. It shows how to use 'augment'
        with an XPath expression to add additional match criteria, action
        criteria, and default actions when no ACE matches are found. All these
        are company proprietary extensions or system feature extensions.
        "example-newco-acl" is just an example and it is expected that vendors
        will create their own proprietary models.</t>

        <t>The following figure is the tree diagram of example-newco-acl. In
        this example,
        /ietf-acl:acls/ietf-acl:acl/ietf-acl:aces/ietf-acl:ace/ietf-acl:matches
        are augmented with two new choices, protocol-payload-choice and
        metadata. The protocol-payload-choice uses a grouping with an
        enumeration of all supported protocol values. Metadata matches apply
        to fields associated with the packet but not in the packet header such
        as overall packet length. In another example,
        /ietf-acl:acls/ietf-acl:acl/ietf-acl:aces/ietf-acl:ace/ietf-acl:actions
        are augmented with a new choice of actions.</t>

      <section title="Linux nftables">
        <t>As Linux platform is becoming more popular as networking platform,
        the Linux data model is changing. Previously ACLs in Linux were highly
        protocol specific and different utilities were used (iptables,
        ip6tables, arptables, ebtables), so each one had separate data model.
        Recently, this has changed and a single utility, nftables, has been
        developed. With a single application, it has a single data model for
        filewall filters and it follows very similarly to the
        ietf-access-control list module proposed in this draft. The nftables
        support input and output ACEs and each ACE can be defined with match
        and action.</t>

        <t>The example in <xref target="example"/> can be configured using
        nftable tool as below.</t>

        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
      nft add table ip filter
      nft add chain filter input
      nft add rule ip filter input ip protocol tcp ip saddr \
          192.0.2.1/24 drop
      ]]></artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>The configuration entries added in nftable would be.</t>

        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
      table ip filter {
        chain input {
          ip protocol tcp ip saddr 192.0.2.1/24 drop
        }
      }

]]></artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>We can see that there are many similarities between Linux nftables
        and IETF ACL YANG data models and its extension models. It should be
        fairly easy to do translation between ACL YANG model described in this
        draft and Linux nftables.</t>

      <section title="Ethertypes">
        <t>The ACL module is dependent on the definition of ethertypes. IEEE
        owns the allocation of those ethertypes. This model is being included
        here to enable definition of those types till such time that IEEE
        takes up the task of publication of the model that defines those
        ethertypes. At that time, this model can be deprecated.</t>
